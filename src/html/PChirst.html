                &emsp; What does it mean to live without fear, pain, or anger? What of love, happiness, or pleasure? Within the Patristic Christian perspective, we have discussed the ideas presented by both Gregory Bishop of Nyssa and Augustine. Both have talked of the five main themes that we have used to center this course those being: mind, guilt, purity/defilement, relationship, and happiness. These five themes have helped us think about the nature of good and evil throughout the course. For this section, I would like to delve deeper into these core themes of the course and question why good and evil lead to suffering as well as pleasure.

                &emsp;Beginning with <i>The Life of Saint Macrina</i> by Gregory, we are told the story of Saint Macrina a priestess and sister to Gregory. Gregory speaks of her sister in a very positive light that reflects her nature as a saint-like figure. In it Gregory speaks of a time where Macrina refrains from falling into sorrow after experiencing the death of her brother stating, “Placing reason in opposition to passion, she kept herself from falling and… she drew her [mother] back again from the depths of grief.” Passions are mentioned in this passage, and it speaks to Macrina’s character who is steadfast to keep away from passions and instead uses reason to uphold herself. Our passions can lead to deceit, and this can be seen in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes story, <i>The Adventure of the Cardboard Box</i>. At the end of the story, after Sherlock has solved the case (spoilers), Sherlock Holmes and Watson receive a statement from the murderer who states that “It was only a little thing, too. I had come into the parlor unexpected, and as I walked in at the door, I saw my wife’s face. But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment.” (9). At the end of the story Sherlock Holmes States “What object is served by this circle of misery and violence and fear?” speaking of the murder’s illicit act as an act of passion (10). It’s interesting food for thought as it acknowledges the notion that passion has no rationale and only serves the purpose for the person who is influenced by it. To be taken hold by intrinsic human emotions is something that cannot be avoided. We all feel fear, anger, and suffering, and dismissing these feelings would not be a valid solution. To dismiss them would be to dismiss evil and evil cannot be rationalized no matter the reason. We must instead aim to act with reason as was exemplified in Macrina after experiencing the death of a family member as it can inhibit our ability rationale and lead to evil as with the murder in the Sherlock Holmes story.

                &emsp;The way in which any rational human would think about life is in terms of happiness. The question of attaining happiness is inherently a question of good and evil. Do our actions speak to our ways of attaining happiness? In Augustine’s text for our course, we see that he speaks of “sexual habit” as a “weight” that “The body, which is corruptible, weighs down the soul…” (127). Speaking in sexual pleasures, Augustine talks of how evil is a result of “corruptible souls” and that his “…justification I [Augustine] had for giving an unqualified judgment on mutable things…” (127). This begets another question of the corruptible itself and how its formation through habit. We aim to be good people, yet we form habits that can inhibit ourselves or allow ourselves to do good things. However, we find that some habits are formed implicitly, things like walking or talking and even matters of love as Augustine describes. If we enjoy something in the past, it is likely that we still enjoy it today. So how are habits acquired, well according to Augustine these are acquired naturally as we progress through life. The idea of habits is expanded upon in Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s <i> The Brother's Karmazov </i> in it he talks of the natures of mankind. The chapter of Rebellion is about two characters Ivan and Alyosha who speak about how humans are capable of evils despite their backgrounds “A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven.” Throughout the chapter, the character Ivan questions the indecencies of humankind to do such evil things to children asking “Why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much! Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child’s prayer to ‘dear, kind God’!”. And this questioning of why God is putting us to a test of sorts is what Ivan assesses through the chapter of Rebellion. “Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though they know they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity them.” Ivan thus explains how our natures to fulfill our needs by doing things we know will lead to unhappiness. It is not that God is presenting a test of sorts, but instead an irrational need that leads to an irrational evil.

                &emsp;But even so we do things we know are wrong for reasons we believe to be correct. The video below is from a scene from a Japanese anime that I thought provided some context on this matter.

                &emsp;It’s illogical to think that we will live forever, yet we go to bed thinking we will wake the next. We come to believe that even if our world is filled with sin, we will still have peace. These seem contradictory to one another, yet we find that we can live with both. Our guilt is often a result of a deficiency for someone or something we have acted upon. This is what Augustine talks of when speaking of Adam and Eve and humanity’s “Original Sin”. He believes that “Man could not disturb the divine purpose by his sin: could not, that is, compel God to change what He had decreed.” (604). We are not capable of understanding the choice that Adam and Eve made when eating the apple. It was an evil act that cannot be rationalized by us as “God foresaw both how evil the man would become whom He Himself had created good and also what good He would nonetheless bring forth from that evil.” (604). Augustine thus believes that we are incapable of possessing evil since God had created all which is good. We are instead corrupted by evils that have no reason since they are outside of God’s creation. Thus, evil acts without reason there is no cause for it. Yet I still implore why it is the case that we feel guilty even if it is born from irrationalities. Perhaps it is our nature to be accepted by God’s goodness and make amends for past actions? To be guilty of something makes one ask if we are attempting to make meaning to the thing that we have been guilty of. Perhaps Augustine is correct in this assessment that we cannot rationalize our evil actions. “The choice of the will, then, is truly free only when it is not the slave of vices and sins. God gave to the will such freedom…” (605).
