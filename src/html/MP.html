                &emsp;Many of the perspectives of good and evil are built off the perspectives that we have discussed in class. Throughout the quarter we were tasked with discussing these perspectives, examining their insights, and highlighting their assets and liabilities. As we move forward into the modern perspectives of good and evil, we see that many of them still apply and have validation in a world that is much more connected than in the past. We see that evil is much more pervasive than it was once thought to be.  War, poverty, and starvation are all things that have been sufferings that were present in the past but have gotten even more server as time has gone on. The modern perspective looks to answer the problem of evil and what it means for us to suffer in a world built by good.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;As Dietrich Bonhoeffer would put it, we live in a world that is “Sicut Deus” or “Without God” or “Like God.” “Standing in the middle means living from its own resources and no longer from the center.” (<i>Creation and Fall</i> 115). We have become much less dependent on the Bible and God’s influence according to Bonhoeffer. Because of our Independence away from God, we are devoid of His influence. However, without limit, we can easily be governed by acts of evil. To live without limits would be unrealistic as it would allow for evil to persist. So, would a theocracy be much more significant than a democracy? We know (due to history) that theologian governments disallow pragmatic relations between the people and its ruler. It’s why many countries in the world today are democratic as it allows for people to give a say in their government. To do away with limits itself is not the answer but a subservient attitude towards them is not right as well. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                &emsp;Discerning what limits should be placed on us in the modern world is not an easy one. Many nations around the world are no longer subjugated to the law of the Bible and instead governed by people. This has been a historical change that has placed the question of how we can build a more stable and just society, one which is not submissive to evil. In James Baldwin’s Going to Meet the Man, we are introduced to the character Jesse who is a white man in mid-20th century America. During this time, many laws were put into place that segregated white Americans from black Americans which in many cases oppressed black Americans. One quote from the book that really caught my attention was when the story talks of Jesse’s thoughts about the black members who publicly protested in the town. “He tried to be a good person and treat everyone right: it wasn’t his fault that the nig**rs had taken it into their heads to fight against God and go against the rules laid down in the Bible for everyone to read!” (235). Jesse, just like many white Americans during this time, used this derogatory language to other black Americans as subservient citizens in his town. Black Americans during this time found it hard to live in America as they were had lacked educational resources, housing opportunities, job opportunities and as a result had very limited freedoms in 20th century America. The language is not exclusive to its time, as many terms that we that are used today also allude to the subjugating an order of some sorts whether it be “Law and Order, “War on Drugs”, among other phrases used to subjugate black or other colored Americans. Therefore, while limits do protect them from evils, we must also be aware of their power to perform evils as well.

                &emsp;Coming back to Bonhoeffer, we understand that he is attempting to understand the nature humanities falling from God. We should strive to do good, yet people still choose to do evil and suffer. “…they[humans] are now made particularly aware of their freedom in unbroken obedience as something in addition to their creatureliness…” (118). I should note that when Bonhoeffer refers to “creatureliness” he means humanity’s obedience to God. This is an aspect of the good is one’s creatureliness. With this in mind, does the same apply to the idea of being a good citizen? To be a good citizen means to follow the rules and not to disobey them. To put goodness in these terms is too simplified. Anyone can follow rules of any kind and be good at just doing that. Instead, we should consider the cases where our decision-making comes into place. This would be much more illustrative of the natures of good and evil rather than law.

            <p>
                &emsp;While the case could be made that we use laws to protect people from evils, we know this is not necessarily accurate. What should we do on this matter should it be handled by us or perhaps we do need a God to make decisions that may be too difficult for us to answer? I present yet another clip from the Japanese anime <i> Trigun</i> that demonstrates the issues of laws. In it, the child Vash (the male child character with the spikey hair)  wants to save a butterfly from a spider’s web by releasing it but the child Knives (the male child with the bushy hair) attempts to save the butterfly in a different matter:

            <p>
                &emsp;The trolley problem comes to mind when observing an issue such as this one. Must we save the spider by allowing it to eat the butterfly or should we allow the butterfly to be free and the spider to starve? Ethical dilemmas such as this one allows us to think about the moral implications of our choice. The novel <i>Night</i> by Elie Wiesel is a sober account of a survivor of the holocaust and his journey through it. In it, Wiesel gives a personal account of how his family was greeted by German soldiers after Germany had captured his nation Hungary. “Their attitudes toward their hosts was distant but polite. They never demanded the impossible, made no offense remarks, and sometimes smiled at the lady of the house.” (24). These signs of humanity that Wiesel describes to the reader reveal how the fundamental nature of humans is not necessarily that of pure evil. The deceptive act put on by the soldiers could be considered evil as it would mean that their intentions themselves were evil. We see it again where evil is mistaken for good when later in the story Wiesel describes the relief after being outside waiting for the last convey to leave the city. “There was joy, yes, joy. People must have thought there could be no greater torment in God’s hell than that of being stranded here, on the sidewalk…” (31). The self-naivety that the author acknowledges demonstrates how the nature of humans is often deluded with the optimism of the good.  Throughout the rest of the book, Wiesel gives an account of the bitter nature of the concentration camps. As a Jewish young man himself, he finds that his religious conventions after entering the camp change and begins to question religious faith. “Blessed be God’s name? Why, but why would I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused thousands of children to burn in His mass grave...” (76). The concentration camps alter his religious conventions and make him question God himself. Why should we children suffer and yet we still bless His name? It seems contrary to what God would want for his children yet allows it to persist.

                &emsp;In a world that is full of evil we can still find peace. This is what I believe to be true and believe that we should strive for as we ask about the nature of good and evil. Despite Elie Wiesel suffering through the holocaust, he was still able to find peace once more and later in life speak against evil. I believe that religious faith can survive in a world that is filled with evil as it allows for us to question our own beliefs and look onto ourselves. As I said before, I had never grown up going to church or have read any parts of the Bible before entering this course this year. But I understand that the Bible can have many meanings that allow us to discuss them in different views. We should be open to others’ views and have disagreements with one another. In this way, we could resolve our differences and even come out with new points of view. By challenging our own convictions, we can learn more about the nature of the subject. This is what I believe to understand good and evil. And it’s why I believe that religion will survive despite the fact the world is full of evils.
