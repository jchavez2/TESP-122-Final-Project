                &emsp;We are aware that evils are present in everyday life. There is no changing this fact and to avoid it would do nothing of its presence. The biblical perspective has driven the notion that evil can be avoided by maintaining a good relationship with God or “covenant”. As an individual who did not grow up going to church in America every day of his life, this was not too familiar to me. Building a relationship that you never personally meant sounded strange and peculiar to me, yet people believed it to be true. I’ve always respected people’s beliefs if they did find faith in this but I was always skeptical. Yet, I found it interesting that so much faith can be put into a book that tells of the beginning of humanity’s creation. And after going through some of the passages of the Bible through this course I can see that there is much more to the text than the origin story of humanity’s creation.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;To start I would like to dive into the idea of maintaining a relationship with God. Throughout the scriptures, we see the importance of being faithful to the words of God as the passage from Exodus describes “Moses answered the people “Do not be afraid, for God has come only to test you and put fear of him upon you so you do not sin.””(19:20). While fear is often used as means of driving one away from another, in this sense fear is used as means to simply keep God’s people from doing misdeeds as described in the passage. In its most basic view, fear is used as a tool to build dependency on God and simply a means to keep believers from incurring evil. Yet, even with fear in place within all human beings (even you believe in God or not) we still are driven to do evil. In fact, it is this fear that can drives us to do evil. This is expressed in the short story <i> A Good Man is Hard to Find </i> by Flannery O’Conner where the character the grandmother (who goes unnamed) talks to a man named Red Sammy about the “good old days” in the “day[s] you could go off and leave your screen door unlatched.” (38). In the story, the grandmother is a religious white woman on a trip with her family to Florida where they stop at Red Sammy's restaurant. In her conversation with Red Sammy, the grandmother then alienates Europeans within the country stating “The old lady said in her opinion Europe was entirely to blame for the way things were…” which only builds the misplaced perception that evil was not already present in everyday life. It appears the grandmother uses her misplaced fear of people’s “changing” nature of the “good old days” on Europeans and othering them as a result.

            <p>
                &emsp; The author O’Conner uses memory as an allusion to the Biblical story of Adam and Eve and humanity’s first evil. The grandmother’s memory is unreliable for her old age, which is exemplified when the grandmother is unable to recognize the Misfit. “The grandmother had a peculiar feeling that the bespectacled man was someone she knew. His face was so familiar to her…” (41). Along with her, the Misfit also has a hard time recalling the misdeed that led him to jail saying “I never was a bad boy that I remember of…” adding weight to the author’s notion that mankind’s sins are without a base. In Adam and Eve, we see clearly that man and woman are the sources of humanity’s first sin “Then the Lord God said: See! The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil! Now, what if he also reaches out his hand to take fruit from the tree of life, and eats of it and lives forever?” (Genesis 3:13). Is that we are born into existence inheriting the sins of our ancestors as the Bible proposes? This doesn’t seem like a satisfactory answer, as all people are capable of evil, yet we are also capable of good as well. If we did inherent evil from our predecessors, then wouldn’t society be more corrupt than it is? Throughout the world, many countries use governments to maintain the responsibility of serving people and their people. Some are better than others, but the fact of the matter is that the world has shifted from one governed by God to one by the people (in most countries).

            <p>
                &emsp;This is not to say that religion has no place in the modern world far from it. We must acknowledge that the Bible does provide a base for the nature of good and evil. The perspective that is presented by Bonhoeffer’s<i> Creation And Fall </i> provides us with the same Adam and Eve story presented in a new lens. The lens that Bonhoeffer provides deals with Adam and Eve not gaining the knowledge of “good and evil” but instead humankind rejecting the limits placed on by God onto themeselves. In this way, we have become “Sicut Deus” or “without God” as described by Bonhoeffer and by this “It consists in its own attempt to be for God, to have access to a new way of ‘being-for-God’, that is, in a special way of being pious.” (116). He questions “How things have come to such a state?” using Adam and Eve’s narrative as a device for his queries of the state of humans. “Humankind’s limit has drawn nearer, but for that reason has become all the more sharply defined.” (118).  But to question the limit only comes naturally as one is under the influence of another. If Adam and Eve did not question the limit that God had placed on them in the Garden of Eden, then would we just be subjugated to God’s will without free will? What can be said about Bonhoeffer’s text is that it provides the readers is a reexamination of the story of the Garden of Eden common tropes of the story are the origin of evil or that it was the discovery of love between man and woman. Evil is not something that can be easily explained because of its peculiar nature. We can provide interpretations for its presence but even then, it is not sufficient to explain evil as one source. 
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;The nature of good and evil is therefore not subjugated to adhering to the good and avoiding the bad. While many of the teachings from the Old Testament offer stories that build strict rules for how one must act to be faithful to God’s relationship, the New Testament offers a way in which one can avoid evil and do good. When talking of Law in the book of Mathew, the Sermon says, “…whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.” (5:19). Much of Mathew uses laws and commandments, drawn up by God told through the Sermon, to instill the relationship one must have with him. One passage suggests that “If God clothes the grass of the field…will he not much provide for you, O you of little faith?” (Mathew 6:30). Remaining faithful in God and his relationship is the cornerstone of both Christianity and Judaism. Perhaps the passage, “You are salt of the earth…” speaks to the faith of the Christian religion as believers should not fall from God’s grace as Bonhoeffer suggests (Matthew 5:13). A believer should instead look to make due to the promise that he has promised to God and remain faithful to his word.

                &emsp; Within the New Testament, we also see that the story of Jesus looks to rekindle the relationship between good and humanity through him. Jesus is the son of God in the Christian religion, and his story is told through Luke. An interesting story that is told in Luke is that of Paying Taxes to the Emperor where two agents of the empire are sent to God to ask him why he does not pay for his taxes. They ask “Teacher, we know that what you say and teach is correct, and you show no partiality, but teach the way of God by the truth. Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or not?” to which Jesus asks for their coin which he asks, “whose image and name does it bear” to which they reply “Caser” he then replies, “Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and God what belongs to God.” (Luke 21:20-21:26). This story struck me the first time I read it and I attempted to parse out what Jesus had meant by his question. Was Jesus attempting to parse out if these individuals had faith in the tangible more than spiritual? Thinking in terms of relationships, I believe that Jesus was attempting to understand our natures for adhering to truehearted nature. To adhere to God is “good”, to adhere to Caesar is also “good”. One is not better than the other, it is our relationship that is the matter. To be in a bad relationship with another is bad and corrupt and should be avoided. “…But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned?”  (Mathew 5:13).
