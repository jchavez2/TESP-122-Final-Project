            <p>
                &emsp;We are aware that evils are present in everyday life. There is no changing this fact and to avoid it would do nothing of its presence. The biblical perspective has driven the notion that evil can be avoided by maintaining a good relationship with God or “covenant”. As an individual who did not grow up going to church in America every day of his life, this was not too familiar to me. Building a relationship that you never personally meant sounded strange and peculiar to me, yet people believed it to be true. I’ve always respected people’s beliefs if they did find faith in this but I was always skeptical. Yet, I found it interesting that so much faith can be put into a book that tells of the beginning of humanity’s creation. And after going through some of the passages of the Bible through this course I can see that there is much more to the text than the origin story of humanity’s creation.
