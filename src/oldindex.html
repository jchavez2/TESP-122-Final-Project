<h1>Theology, Ethics, & Sprituality (TESP) 122: Good and Evil</h1>
<h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of this website is to showcase my course material that I have produced throughout 10-weeks of the course as a final project for the class. I took this course in Winter of 2022 as a fourth-year at Santa Clara University (SCU).   
</p>

<p>
    Going into this course, I thought I had an adequate understanding of what good and evil. 
    This class changed that, making me see that good and evil are not as black and white as I once thought them to be.
    From the beginning of the course our professor warned us that the material we would be engaging with in this course were rough subjects. 
    This told me that the material in this course we would be dealing with had some heavy subjects, which delt with evils we often do not think of from day to day.
    Often we pay more attention being good, feeling well nourished or being told thank you, then we do being evil.
    Evil is something humans we <i>want</i> to avoid yet seem to go back to despite our good intentions. 
    Our ablity to understand the nature of good, as our professor says, "requires our attention" throughout the course, but evil "arrests our attention and demands a response".
    The texts presented within the course do provide answers to the phenomenons of evil and yet evil still exists.
    These frameworks do employ ways in which we should be thinking about the reasons for evil and how we should we respond to them, but they also present in themselves contradictory attuides on our responses towards them.
    It is therefore our job to understand these frameworks and assess the rationality of these arguments presented to systhesize our own response to evil for when it does occur.
