            &emsp; The purpose of this website is to engage with the class perspectives presented throughout the TESP 122 course. I'll be looking into two ancient perspectives as well as a "Modern perspective". The two ancient perspectives I’ll be diving into will be "Biblical" and "Patristic Christain" perspectives. Through this assessment I will better understand through applying the knowledge of the class and gaining an understanding of the nature of the good and evil through a modern lens. This will not only enhance my knowledge as a college student but also serve to build my ability to critically think about real-life issues. With all that said let’s get started with an introduction provided in the next paragraph.

            &emsp; We know the differences between good and bad, it’s what was taught to us at a young age. Our childlike desire for the cookie in the cookie jar (or whatever snack we had as a child) is what we are told to eat unless we are granted permission by our parents. We know it's good to obey our parents' rules yet we still desire the snack that makes our mouth salivate at the thought of eating the snack we are craving to eat. This simple analogy of our childish desire for the cookie in the cookie jar is imperative to understanding the problems related to questions relating to good and evil simply because we all have at one point in our lives experienced this same delima. What might these our discontent with not getting the cookie mean besides the dissatisfaction of not eating the cookie itself? Why are some children not compelled to take the cookie while others do? These questions allow us to build a surface level understanding of some of the fundamental notions of good and evil that are present in our everyday life. By building on top of these ideas we can dive deeper into some of the more gripping questions that good and evil have to offer.

            As a final project for the Theology, Ethics, & Sprituality (TESP) 122: Good and Evil course I took as a fourth year at Santa Clara University (SCU) I designed this website to share my views of the prespectives visted through the course.
